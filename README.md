Basic Jasmine template, ready to work with local files. 

Just open the index.html file in your browser or run 

```bash
karma start 
```

from root folder. If you don't have karma installed, do it with this command (it requires [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/))

```bash
npm install -g karma karma-jasmine jasmine-core karma-phantomjs-launcher
```
